## Grimes Simple Revive

Created with user-friendliness and quality assurance in mind, Grimes Simple Revive is a Revive script for Arma 3 that sets itself apart from other Revive Scripts due to the fact that it is exceptionally organized and simplified for ease-of-use by mission editors of all levels, while still offering unique features. Although this script contains a variety of features on top of its original action-based Revive System, all features, in addition to already having default values set, are organized by relevancy in a simple way that allows editors to adapt this script to their mission, including enabling/disabling features as desired. 

Highlights:
* Singleplayer (SP), Multiplayer (MP), PvP/TvT/COOP, Save/Load, Dedicated Server, & Join-In-Progress (JIP) Support
	* For SP, consider running your SP mission as an MP Host. This allows for the use of parameters anyway, allowing you to make your mission more diverse!
* Minimal setup required; quick and easy installation
* Integrated parameter validation system to ensure the script is being utilized effectively
* Revive your teammates, whether they are players or AI, including in water
* Drag & Carry players and AI, whether they are your teammates or not
* Load incapacitated teammates into vehicles, and Unload them at your destination
* AI will operate in a guard-rescuer pair to realistically navigate to and revive teammates (even when vehicles are involved)
	* AI inclusion is by side and requires no extra work, and individual exclusions from the script can be made by name
* Integrate with your respawn settings: works with all respawn types, including the highly recommended Respawn Menu for respawn point selection
* Available Mobile Respawn Vehicle (MRV) and Squad Leader Respawn systems which include optional markers
* Utilization of BI functions and dialogs wherever possible to be as stock and fast as possible
* Available immersive options such as black screen and muting ACRE2/TFAR while incapacitated
* Available “unit tags” that mark friendly players and AI on your HUD
* Available Spectator Mode for use when lives run out
* Available pre-placed custom execution lines to run your own scripts within this one
* Loads of other large and small features! Check out the parameters for more details. 

This package includes an application of the script as part of an example mission. 

This README is intended to provide detailed information as to the purpose, function, FAQs, and minor troubleshooting for this script in addition to installation, uninstallation, and maintenance tips. For further information or specifics in the code, the user should read the comments to the code within the script files. 

## Author Information

Kent “KC” Grimes of Austin, Texas, United States is the author of the Grimes Simple Revive script. The script was made in order to provide mission makers a user-friendly means of utilizing a revive system.

The purpose of this script is to provide a way for the mission maker to easily implement the revive and spawning abilities into gameplay in order to make their mission unique.

## Installation

At this time, there is no “installer” for the script, and it is instead a simple series of actions and file moves.  

1. Obtain the script files
	1. Armaholic: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=25662
	1. github: https://github.com/kcgrimes/grimes-simple-revive/releases
	1. Steam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1349229256
2. Extract the “Grimes_Simple_Revive.stratis” folder and place it somewhere on your computer that is easily accessible, such as Desktop or your MP Missions folder.
3. In the folder that contains your mission.sqm (ie, “my_mission.stratis”), do the following:
	1. If you haven’t already created a description.ext file, simply copy the provided one into your mission folder. If you already have your own description.ext, simply copy and paste the following line into it. Note: If you already have a defines.hpp or similarly purposed file, you may need to check for conflicts.
	```
	#include "G_Revive\G_Desc_Include.hpp"
	```
	2. If you haven’t already created an init.sqf file, simply copy the provided one into your mission folder. If you already have your own init.sqf, simply copy and paste the following line into it. Note: This line must go towards the top, specifically before any suspension statements (waitUntil, sleep, etc.).
	```
	[] execVM "G_Revive_init.sqf";
	```
	3. Copy and Paste the G_Revive_init.sqf file and the G_Revive folder into your mission folder. 
4. That is all that is required for the file implementation! Depending on your settings, you will still need make some edits in the in-game editor. 
	1. If using respawn, adjust the editor-based respawn settings as you desire, and remember to create markers named “respawn_west_0”, “respawn_west_1”, etc. for the desired side if necessary. 
	1. If using the Mobile Respawn Vehicle (MRV), be sure to name your vehicle in the Name field when you double-click on the vehicle in the editor.

## Tests

The script is designed to exit upon critical failure and it will attempt to announce the problem in chat. These types of failures are intended for development, and should never be encountered down the road if they were not encountered at launch, save for software updates. Upon setup or completion of modifications, it is recommended that the user, before launch, run the script in a test environment.
