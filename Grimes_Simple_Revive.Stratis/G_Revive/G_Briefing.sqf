	"How To Use", 
	"
	<br/><font size='18'>How To Use</font>
	<br/>     Below is some information relating to the in-game utilization of Grimes' Simple Revive Script. 
	<br/>
	<br/>* To Revive an Unconscious teammate, simply approach them and use the Action Menu.
	<br/>
	<br/>* To Drag or Carry any Unconscious unit (doesn't have to be a teammate!), simply approach them and use the Action Menu. NOTE: Sometimes the animation will force a certain position. If you are in Drag and not moving, simply press Q, W, or E in addition to S and you will be able to move again (the issue is the game's Walk mechanic).
	<br/>
	<br/>* To Load a wounded teammate into a vehicle, simply move them or the vehicle within range and use the Action Menu on the Unconscious unit. If a unit is killed in a vehicle, they will have to be Unloaded first.
	<br/>
	<br/>* If the Mobile Respawn Vehicle system is being used, simply approach the team's MRV and use the Action Menu to Deploy/Undeploy the vehicle. This allows for teammates to spawn on it.
	<br/>
	<br/>* If the Unit Tag System is enabled, you will either always see teammate's name tags, see them when you cursor over them, or see them after pressing a defined key (Default is Left Alt, but can be edited by mission maker).
